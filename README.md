# SplitUp-vba-script
Simple vba script that splits a spreadsheet into multiple tabs based on the values in a specified column.

Feel free to use in any context other than commercial re-sale. Not that you'd really want or need to, I think? It's pretty simple.

Two ways to use:
- To import into Excel as a module, download SplitUp.bas and import into Visual Basic editor.
- To incorporate into a pre-existing module, copy the text from SplitUp.vba and paste into your module.
